# Lesson 28 Excersise

```javascript
let person = {
    name: "Alice Smith",
    age: 30,
    address: {
        street: "123 Main St",
        city: "Springfield",
        zipCode: "12345"
    }
};
```

- Create an array of objects representing persons, with a minimum of 3 objects. Each object should have a method named about to display a composed short description about the person.

- At the end, check if the objects have the same address. If true, log siblings to the console; otherwise, log no-related.
